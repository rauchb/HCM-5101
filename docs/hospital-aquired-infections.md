## Hospital Acquired infections

Harm events:
- Adverse event (injury caused by healthcare professionals)
- near-miss (potential adverse event identified before it caused harm to patients)
- medical errors (a mistake that did not affect the patient's health) [[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#3) 

Hospitals, especially those with major concerns for malpractice implications, were less likely to disclose preventable harm outcomes, compared to non-preventable outcomes of comparable severity. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4)
