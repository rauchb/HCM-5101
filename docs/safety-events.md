## Safety Events

In a healthcare setting, safety emphasizes the absence of medical errors, specifically errors that could negatively affect clinical and health outcomes. [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

A safety event is “any process, act of omission, or commissions that causes hazardous health care conditions or unintended harm to the patient.”[[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

In a 2005 analysis, harm was found to be most associated with therapeutic intent of an activity, language barriers, errors of judgement, communication from another office, mistiming of procedure, and medication errors. [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

## Harm Events

Harm events:
- Adverse event (injury caused by healthcare professionals)
- near-miss (potential adverse event identified before it caused harm to patients)
- medical errors (a mistake that did not affect the patient's health) [[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#3) 

## Disclosure of Preventable Harm

Hospitals, especially those with major concerns for malpractice implications, were less likely to disclose preventable harm outcomes, compared to non-preventable outcomes of comparable severity. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4)
