## Public Reporting

Public reporting is the practice of collecting a set of data for the purpose of releasing broadly and free of charge. This data may be related to healthcare structures, processes, or outcomes; the report may be released at the provider, institution, or health plan level of detail. [[11]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#11) In addition to improving transparency, public reporting is a mechanism for improving quality and patient safety.

### Institute of Medicine Report
Institute of Medicine report of 1999 [[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#2) 

Medical errors occurring in hospitals cause between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths of Americans each year. [[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#2) 

### Impact of IOM Report

Motivated hospitals to adopt move safety practices, and placed an emphasis on patient safety [such as creating roles like Chief Safety Officer]. Slower rate than called for by IOM report. [[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#5)

Public reporting led to national discussion, as well as regionally and nationally-based improvement initiatives to promote safe practices and set infection-prevention goals [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) 

#### Measurement of Impact: A 2003 Review

National study including for-profit and non-profit hospitals, selected by stratified random sampling (by faculty size and geographic region) of hospitals with 200 or more beds. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4) 

Only one in three responding hospitals had board-approved disclosure policies. However 80% (in 2003) had polies in place or under development. Disclosures were described and classified by the following elements [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4):
- Explanation
- Undertaking to investigate the incident
- Apology
- Achnkowledgement of harm
- Declaration of responsibility
- Promise to share investigation results with patients/families   

17% of hospitals routinely released disclosures with all six of the above elements. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4)

### Public Reporting as Quality Improvement

Significant relationship between safety culture and nursing-sensitive patient outcomes (e.g. fewer medication errors, patient falls) [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

By reporting adverse events and near misses
Enables safety specializes to investigate, identify underlying factors, and mitigate risks [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10)
