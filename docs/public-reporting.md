## Public Reporting

This page will be about Public reporting.

Public reporting led to national discussion, as well as regionally and nationally-based improvement initiatives to promote safe practices and set infection-prevention goals [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) 

Institute of Medicine report of 1999 [[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#2) 

Medical errors occurring in hospitals cause between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths of Americans each year. [[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#2) 

Non-U.S. study found that simplicity and anonymity of reporting significantly improve rates of reporting safety events. [[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#3) 

National study including for-profit and non-profit hospitals, selected by stratified random sampling (by faculty size and geographic region) of hospitals with 200 or more beds. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4) 

Only one in three responding hospitals had board-approved disclosure policies. However 80% (in 2003) had polies in place or under development. Disclosures were described and classified by the following elements [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4):
- Explanation
- Undertaking to investigate the incident
- Apology
- Achnkowledgement of harm
- Declaration of responsibility
- Promise to share investigation results with patients/families   

17% of hospitals routinely released disclosures with all six of the above elements. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4)

Motivated hospitals to adopt move safety practices, and placed an emphasis on patient safety [such as creating roles like Chief Safety Officer]. Slower rate than called for by IOM report. [[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#5)

### Importance of a PSRS 
[[9]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#9)  
Evaluation of web-based patient safety reporting system (PSRS)
Reporting via PSRS leads to analysis (crucial step), leads to root cause analysis, leads to imrpovements in procedures and reduced future harm
Example: For example, one hospital identified insufficient staff knowledge as the main cause of events related to the use of intracranial pressure monitoring devices. This recognition led to an improved staff training program.
Collection within a hospital of system can identify site-specific imrpovements; public reporting can pool common causes of harm for widespread awareness and policy change
