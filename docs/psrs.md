## Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS)


Reporting patient safety events appears to be an effective approach for improving patient safety. [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

In healthcare, reporting is promoted through anonymous reporting, meaningful feedback, and greater ease to report. [[10]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#10) 

Non-U.S. study found that simplicity and anonymity of reporting significantly improve rates of reporting safety events. [[3]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#3) 

### Importance of a PSRS

Evaluation of web-based patient safety reporting system (PSRS)
Reporting via PSRS leads to analysis (crucial step), leads to root cause analysis, leads to imrpovements in procedures and reduced future harm
Example: For example, one hospital identified insufficient staff knowledge as the main cause of events related to the use of intracranial pressure monitoring devices. This recognition led to an improved staff training program.
Collection within a hospital of system can identify site-specific imrpovements; public reporting can pool common causes of harm for widespread awareness and policy change
