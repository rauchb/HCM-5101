### Institute of Medicine Report
In 1999, the Institute of Medicine released a report, "_To Err is Human_". The purpose of the investigation and publication was to bring attention and focus to healthcare safety. The report revealed that medical errors occurring in hospitals caused between 44,000 and 98,000 deaths of Americans each year. [[2]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#2) 

### Impact of IOM Report
The Institute of Medicine's 1999 report is largely credited as the impetus for nationwide efforts to study and improve healthcare safety. Hospitals were motivated to adopt more safety practices, and often create new roles or departments focused on patient safety. [[1]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#1) The public reporting of medical errors in hospitals led to both public and industry focus, as well as regionally and nationally-based improvement initiatives to promote safe practices and set infection-prevention goals. 

Despite the attention brought to patient safety by "_To Err is Human_", there is disagreement on whether safety outcomes have been improved. It is generally believed the change has occured at a slower rate than the urgency called for by the report. [[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#5)

#### Measurement of Impact: A 2003 Review [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4) 
National study including for-profit and non-profit hospitals, selected by stratified random sampling (by faculty size and geographic region) of hospitals with 200 or more beds. 

Only one in three responding hospitals had board-approved disclosure policies. However 80% (in 2003) had polies in place or under development. Disclosures were described and classified by the following elements:
- Explanation
- Undertaking to investigate the incident
- Apology
- Achnkowledgement of harm
- Declaration of responsibility
- Promise to share investigation results with patients/families   

17% of hospitals routinely released disclosures with all six of the above elements.
