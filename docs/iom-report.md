Motivated hospitals to adopt move safety practices, and placed an emphasis on patient safety [such as creating roles like Chief Safety Officer]. Slower rate than called for by IOM report. [[5]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#5)

#### Measurement of Impact: A 2003 Review

National study including for-profit and non-profit hospitals, selected by stratified random sampling (by faculty size and geographic region) of hospitals with 200 or more beds. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4) 

Only one in three responding hospitals had board-approved disclosure policies. However 80% (in 2003) had polies in place or under development. Disclosures were described and classified by the following elements [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4):
- Explanation
- Undertaking to investigate the incident
- Apology
- Achnkowledgement of harm
- Declaration of responsibility
- Promise to share investigation results with patients/families   

17% of hospitals routinely released disclosures with all six of the above elements. [[4]](https://rauchb.github.io/HCM-5101/sources.html#4)
